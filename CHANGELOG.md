# 2.0.0 (2023-10-28)

- support habboden for fetching avatar data
  - since the public origins api still returns borked figure string, this is the only real option (thanks Colouring!)
- **breaking:** `avatarImageUrl` no longer fetches avatar figure string for you - it must be provided

# 1.0.0 (2023-08-25)

- initial release
